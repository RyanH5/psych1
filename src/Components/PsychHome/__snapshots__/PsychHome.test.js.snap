                    This website is intended to provide resources to assist you in making decisions about your physical health, brain health and emotional health. I have been working in the field of psychology for over 25 years. My practice involves providing resilience training to healthcare providers, schools and families. In addition, I provide Effective Parenting Seminars as well as psychotherapy for children, adolescents, adults and families. I am often invited to speak to parents, school staff, healthcare professionals, and organizations about developing mind-body- heart skills and resiliency skills.
