### Movie Tracker
This application pulls the most recent 20 movies from the MovieDbApi at, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and displays them with title, vote average, and image. The app uses modular card components to render different data. There is a favorite option that allows users to "favorite" movies and keep track of their favorite movies. The app is fully responsive.
Building this application was a chance for me to experience an agile workflow, working with a client. I updated his outdated website to be responsive, accessible, and with an emphasis on SEO. I used React, Redux, and Router to fetch and display the most recent news articles pertinent to the various pages.
